# 📘 LeetCode Grind – Java Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Grind repo! 👨‍💻  
This is where I document my problem-solving journey — writing, organizing, and refining Java solutions to LeetCode problems, one challenge at a time.

It’s part habit, part discipline, and part prep for cracking coding interviews.

## 🧩 What’s Inside?

Problems are sorted by **difficulty**: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.  
Each problem lives in its own folder and includes:

- 📝 `ProblemName.java` – My Java solution  
- 📄 `ProblemName.txt` – Brief notes or the problem statement (if needed)

The goal is to keep things clean and revisit-friendly.

- To level up my Java and DSA understanding  
- To have a clear, version-controlled record of progress  
- To make revision easier closer to interviews  
- And maybe, to help someone else along the way
